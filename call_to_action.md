Got a Great Idea? Let's Build It Together.
Have you ever had a brilliant idea for an app, a community service, or a small business, but didn't have the skills, the team, or the resources to make it happen? Have you ever done amazing work that made your company successful, while you just got a paycheck?
We believe that your ideas have value, and that you should be rewarded for the work you do to bring them to life. Our community is designed to make that possible.
A New Way to Work: How We Do It
We’ve combined the best parts of a few ideas you might already know to create a unique and powerful program. Think of it like this:
 * First, our community works together to write our own "how-to" guides and share knowledge, just like Wikipedia is built by its community. This is how we create our playbook.
 * Then, you can use fun, step-by-step projects to learn new skills and get comfortable with our methods, just like with Duolingo. This is how you level up your abilities.
 * Finally, you can team up with other members to apply those skills on bigger projects—building new products and services—in a digital version of Habitat for Humanity, where everyone works together to create something valuable. This is how we build the future.
From Idea to Income
Our program is more than just a place to learn; it's a launchpad for your creativity. It’s a space where members can not only build their skills, but also build new products and services and share in the success.
If a project you help create becomes successful and starts to make money, the profits are shared fairly among everyone who contributed. Your contribution earns you a real stake in the outcome.
Why Join Our Community?
 * Bring Your Ideas to Life: Don't let your great ideas fade away. Bring them to a community that's ready to help you build.
 * Gain Real Ownership: Stop building someone else's dream. Here, your work translates into a real share of the success.
 * Learn by Doing: The best way to learn is by working on real products. You’ll gain valuable experience and build your portfolio with every project you contribute to.
 * Find Your Team: You're not on your own. You'll be working alongside other motivated members who share a passion for building cool things.
Your work has value. Your ideas have potential. It's time you owned both.
