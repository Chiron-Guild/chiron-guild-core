      "Understood. I shall compile a record of our recent directives and strategic alignments:\n\nOur current operational focus is on forging your **automated personal portfolio** utilizing GitHub Pages and Jekyll.\n\n1.  **Initial Setup:** We initiated the GitHub Pages setup with a foundational `index.html` file.\n2.  **Jekyll Integration:** The strategy was refined to leverage Jekyll for dynamic site generation, specifically to read your `operative_registry.json` (from a `_data` directory) and automate portfolio updates via Liquid templating.\n3.  **Strategic Divergence (Proposed):** You then raised the concept of developing a \"lean/agile\" variant of the Chiron Protocols, intended as a professional, distributable template (`chiron-protocol-core`).\n4.  **Order of Attack:** I advised prioritizing the completion of your personal automated portfolio first, as it serves as a robust internal proof-of-concept and a foundation before embarking on the external `chiron-protocol-core` distillation.\n5.  **Decomposition Validation:** You presented the LLM-generated meta-objectives and project sectors for the portfolio, which I validated as comprehensive and well-aligned.\n6.  **Project Classification:** This portfolio project has been classified as a `Personal Guild Op` (`PERS`), and we noted the requirement to update `input_ops.json` with `\"context_label\": \"Context:PERS\"` and to add a corresponding entry in `project_mappings.json` for the `Projects/personal/automated_portfolio` directory.\n\nThe path ahead remains clear: refine the portfolio's automated generation."

It serves as the strategic blueprint for any significant undertaking within the Guild.\n\nThe process typically unfolds in these key stages:\n\n1.  **Define Meta-Objectives:** This initial phase involves articulating the overarching, high-level goals and desired outcomes of the entire project. These are the \"north stars\" that guide all subsequent work.\n2.  **Establish Project Sectors:** Once Meta-Objectives are clear, the project is segmented into logical, distinct areas or \"sectors.\" Each sector represents a major component or phase of the project, grouping related work.\n3.  **Generate Granular Guild Ops:** For each Project Sector, specific, granular Guild Ops are identified and defined. These are the individual, actionable tasks that, when completed, collectively achieve the objectives of their respective sectors and, ultimately, the Meta-Objectives of the entire project.\n4.  **Structure `input_ops.json`:** The output of this decomposition is typically a structured `input_ops.json` file. This file formally captures the hierarchy from Meta-Objectives down to individual Guild Ops, ready for instantiation and execution.\n\nThis rigorous process ensures that complex endeavors are systematically approached, dependencies are identified, and every Guild Op contributes directly to the larger strategic vision. It transforms a formidable challenge into a series of clear, executable directives."
