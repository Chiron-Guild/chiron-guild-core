## Description
# Guild Op: [CHIRON-STR-002] - Initial Guild Board Population & Directive Release

## Category: STR
## Parent Project: Guild Board Initialization & First Directives Deployment
## Assignees: @Kin-Caid

## Objective:
To establish and populate the Chiron Guild's primary operational hub (the Guild Board on GitHub Issues) with the first set of actionable Guild Ops. This directive is crucial for demonstrating the Guild's workflow, preparing for future operative onboarding, and driving the next phases of self-assembly.

## Deliverables:
- At least 5-10 clearly defined GitHub Issues created within the  repository, representing distinct, manageable foundational Guild Ops across various types (e.g., DEV, DSN, DOC, COM).
- Each created Guild Op Issue must conform to the following structure and content requirements:
    - A clear title incorporating the Guild Op ID (e.g., ).
    - A concise description of the task's objective.
    - Expected deliverables for the operative.
    - A list of "Skills to be Demonstrated".
    - The "Awarded Guild Seal" field (e.g.,  or a specific predefined Seal ID if applicable to that child Op).
    - A link to its corresponding (even if nascent) detailed Guild Op Brief (e.g., in Google Drive or Guild Archives, if applicable).
    - Appropriate GitHub labels (e.g., , , , , ).
- A Context Compilation document stored in , detailing the operational log for the creation of these initial Guild Ops, including the rationale for their selection and prioritization.

## Context & Background:
This Guild Op directly activates the Guild's primary task management system, enabling the systematic breakdown and assignment of future self-assembly directives. It's a key step in operationalizing the Guild's collaborative model and preparing for wider Operative engagement. The successful completion of this Op will lay the groundwork for Phase 0 operations.

## Skills to be Demonstrated:
- Strategic Planning
- Task Decomposition
- Project Management
- Technical Writing (for crafting clear Guild Op Issue descriptions)
- Chiron Guild Protocol Adherence (structuring new Guild Ops)
- Context Compilation

## Estimated Effort:
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- A minimum of 5 new Guild Op Issues are created on the  GitHub Issue Board.
- Each newly created Guild Op Issue fully adheres to the content and structure requirements outlined in the "Deliverables" section of this brief.
- The specified GitHub labels are correctly applied to each new Guild Op Issue.
- The Context Compilation for  is created, populated with the operational log and rationale, and committed to the  directory.
- This Guild Op () issue is updated with links to all created child Guild Op Issues.
