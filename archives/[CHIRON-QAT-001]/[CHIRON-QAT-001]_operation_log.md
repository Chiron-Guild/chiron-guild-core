## Description
# Guild Op: [CHIRON-QAT-001] - End-to-End Test Execution for Guild Op Automation Suite (Ref: DEV-004)

## Category: QAT
## Parent Project: Phase 0: Guild Automation Verification
## Assignees: @Kin-Caid (or designated QAT Operative)
## Prerequisite Guild Op: [CHIRON-DEV-004] - Core Guild Op Workflow Automation Suite (must be deployed)

## Objective:
To rigorously test and verify the functionality, reliability, and adherence to protocol of the automated GitHub Actions workflows developed and deployed under Guild Op . This includes the , , and  workflows, ensuring they perform as specified throughout the entire Guild Op lifecycle.

## Deliverables:
- **Test Plan Document:** A concise document outlining the scope of testing, specific test cases (including positive and negative/edge case scenarios if applicable), preconditions, steps, and expected outcomes for each workflow. Stored in .
- **Executed Test Case Log:** A detailed record of each test case execution, including:
    - Test Case ID
    - Actual results observed
    - Pass/Fail status
    - Links to relevant GitHub Actions workflow runs as evidence
    - Screenshots or log snippets for failures or unexpected behavior
    Stored in  (or a structured spreadsheet).
- **Verified  State:** Confirmation (e.g., a diff or snapshot) that  is correctly updated with all specified fields from at least one successfully processed end-to-end test Guild Op.
- **Bug Report Summary (if applicable):** A list of any identified bugs, defects, or deviations from expected behavior, with clear steps to reproduce. Each bug should ideally be logged as a new GitHub Issue and linked from this summary. Stored in .
- **Completed Context Compilation for CHIRON-QAT-001:** A comprehensive log detailing the entire testing process, including test environment setup, tools used, observations, rationale for test case selection, and overall assessment of the automation suite's readiness. Stored in .

## Context & Background:
The workflows developed in  are critical for the Guild's operational efficiency and adherence to the Precision Shell ethos. This QAT (Quality Assurance Testing) Guild Op is essential to ensure these automations are robust, reliable, and function correctly before they are depended upon for day-to-day Guild operations. This Op will simulate the complete lifecycle of one or more "test" Guild Ops to validate each stage of the automation.

## Skills to be Demonstrated:
- Quality Assurance Methodologies
- Test Case Design & Execution
- GitHub Actions (understanding workflow triggers, inputs, outputs, and logs)
- Attention to Detail & Analytical Skills
- Systematic Problem Identification
- Technical Documentation (Test Plans, Logs, Bug Reports, Context Compilation)
- Understanding of Guild Op Lifecycle & Protocols
- Git & GitHub Usage (creating issues, branches, PRs for testing purposes)

## Estimated Effort:
Medium (4-8 hours) - Depending on the number of test cases and depth of investigation required.

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- The Test Plan Document is created, reviewed (if applicable), and available in the specified archive location.
- All test cases defined in the Test Plan are executed, and their results are meticulously logged in the Executed Test Case Log.
- At least one complete end-to-end lifecycle test of a "dummy" Guild Op successfully proceeds through:
    1. Issue creation, triggering .
    2. Correct directory and  scaffolding on a feature branch.
    3. (Manual simulation of work completion on the branch).
    4. Issue closure, triggering .
    5. Successful PR creation to .
    6. (Manual PR merge).
    7. Successful triggering of .
    8. Correct update of  with all expected fields from the test Guild Op issue body.
- All workflows under test demonstrate correct handling of expected inputs and produce the specified outputs.
- The  is confirmed to be accurately updated by the  script via the workflow.
- Any identified bugs or issues are documented in the Bug Report Summary and/or as separate GitHub Issues.
- The Context Compilation for  is complete, comprehensive, and correctly archived.

## Awarded Guild Seal:
GS-QAT-WorkflowVerified-v1 (Awarded upon successful verification of the automation suite's functionality through comprehensive testing)

## Notes for Operatives:
- You will need to create one or more "dummy" Guild Op Issues to trigger and test the workflows. Ensure these test issues are clearly identifiable (e.g., prefixed with "[TEST]").
- For each test Guild Op, meticulously follow the standard lifecycle: create issue, (simulate work on a branch named ), close issue, merge PR.
- Pay close attention to the content of the  after the  workflow runs to ensure all fields (Objective, Deliverables, Skills, Effort, Acceptance Criteria, Seal) are correctly parsed and included from the test issue body.
- Document any deviations, errors, or unexpected behavior encountered in the GitHub Actions logs and your test log immediately.
- Reference the deliverables and acceptance criteria of  to understand the expected behavior of the workflows.
- Ensure the feature branch for this QAT Op () primarily contains the testing documentation (Test Plan, Logs, Context Compilation).
