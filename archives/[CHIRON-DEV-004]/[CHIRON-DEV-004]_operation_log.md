## Description
# Guild Op: [CHIRON-DEV-004] - Core Guild Op Workflow Automation Suite

## Category: DEV
## Parent Project: Phase 0: Guild Bootstrapping & Core Protocol Establishment
## Assignees: @Kin-Caid

## Objective:
To implement and fully operationalize the automated GitHub Actions workflows that streamline the end-to-end Guild Op lifecycle, from initial issue creation and directory scaffolding to Pull Request generation and Operative Registry updates. This objective aims to significantly reduce manual overhead, enforce protocol adherence, and enhance the efficiency and reliability of Guild Op execution.

## Deliverables:
- **Functional  Workflow:** GitHub Action deployed to  that, upon Guild Op Issue creation with a valid title, automatically scaffolds the  directory and  file on a dedicated feature branch (e.g., ).
- **Functional  Workflow:** GitHub Action deployed to  that, upon closure of the corresponding Guild Op Issue, automatically generates a Pull Request from the Guild Op's feature branch to the  branch, demonstrating resolution of previously identified branch existence and label handling issues.
- **Functional  Workflow:** GitHub Action deployed to  that correctly triggers upon the merge of a Guild Op's Pull Request to  and successfully updates the  file, demonstrating resolution of prior GitHub Script context and parsing issues.
- **Updated  Script:** The Python script located in  is confirmed to correctly parse and include Objective, Deliverables, Skills Demonstrated, Estimated Effort, Acceptance Criteria, and Awarded Guild Seal from the Guild Op Issue body into the .
- **Completed Context Compilation for CHIRON-DEV-004:** A comprehensive Context Compilation document detailing the development, debugging, testing, and verification process of this automation suite, including decision logs, relevant code snippets, and test results, stored in .

## Context & Background:
This Guild Op is foundational to solidifying the Guild's Precision Shell. It moves critical, repetitive manual steps into a reliable automated pipeline, enabling Operatives (including Kin-Caid in Phase 0) to focus on core work rather than administrative overhead. Successful completion ensures that the Reputation Matrix is accurately populated and that the overall Guild Op workflow is robust and scalable for future Chironian engagement. This builds directly upon the foundational protocols established in .

## Skills to be Demonstrated:
- GitHub Actions Development (YAML)
- Workflow Design & Debugging
- Python Scripting (for , including regex parsing)
- GitHub API Interaction (via GitHub Actions context and Work seamlessly with GitHub from the command line.

## Estimated Effort:
X-Large (16+ hours) - Reflecting the complexity of integrating, debugging, and verifying multiple interconnected GitHub Actions and the underlying Python script.

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- All three specified GitHub Actions workflows (, , ) are deployed to the  directory in the  repository.
- An end-to-end test case demonstrates successful automation:
    1. A new Guild Op Issue is created with a valid title.
    2. The  workflow successfully creates the archive directory and  on a new feature branch.
    3. (Manual step: Work is notionally completed and pushed to the feature branch).
    4. The Guild Op Issue is closed.
    5. The  workflow successfully creates a Pull Request to .
    6. (Manual step: The PR is reviewed and merged).
    7. The  workflow successfully triggers and updates  with all expected fields from the original issue.
- The  script successfully extracts and populates all specified fields (Objective, Deliverables, Skills Demonstrated, Estimated Effort, Acceptance Criteria, Awarded Guild Seal) into .
- All previously observed errors in the workflow runs (including shell parsing errors, github-script context issues, branch existence checks, and label existence/handling for PRs) are confirmed resolved through successful workflow executions.
- The Context Compilation for  is complete, comprehensive, correctly archived, and reflects the development and debugging journey.

## Awarded Guild Seal:
GS-DEV-WorkflowAutomate-v1 (Awarded upon successful verification and deployment of the complete automation suite)

## Notes for Operatives:
- This Guild Op is highly iterative. Expect to use dummy/test Guild Ops frequently to ensure all workflow triggers, branches, and data parsing work as intended across various scenarios.
- Implement robust error logging and verbose output within workflow steps during development to expedite debugging.
- Ensure all final changes to the workflow YAML files and the  script are committed to a dedicated feature branch (e.g., ) before final integration into .
- Document every significant debugging challenge, solution, and design decision in the Context Compilation. Consider including links to relevant workflow run logs for major breakthroughs or resolved issues.

## Notes
- This is a generated log file for tracking Guild Op metadata.
- Update this file with progress logs, decisions, and schematics as needed.
