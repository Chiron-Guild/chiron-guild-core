# Chiron Guild 🛡️🤖

**AI-Augmented Guilds for Collective Intelligence & Worker Empowerment**

Chiron Guild is a community-driven platform that transforms how complex projects are tackled—through human + AI collaboration, mission-based work, and equitable participation. We're building a system that empowers contributors, learners, and freelancers while protecting against extractive commercial use.

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building

A platform that:

* Accepts large, complex projects from clients or community needs
* Uses AI + human processes to break them into missions
* Enables contributors to learn, earn, and grow through structured, gamified collaboration
* Transparently documents how AI tools and humans interact throughout the project lifecycle
* Builds toward a self-assembling, community-owned system of collective intelligence

## 🧠 Mythic Core, Professional Shell

While our tone is outwardly professional, the spirit is inspired by sci-fi and video games. We're building something bold—a modern guild system where **reputation**, **mastery**, and **collaboration** matter.

---

## 🚧 Phase 0: Founding Missions

We’re in **Phase 0: the Bootstrapping Era** of Chiron Guild.
Our first "client project" is to **build Chiron Guild itself**—the tools, workflows, governance, and documentation that will power future projects.

### 🔥 How You Can Help Right Now

* **Shape the Platform** — Help design workflows, prompts, and infrastructure
* **Build the Tools** — Contribute code, templates, and project management tools
* **Write the Lore** — Document the process, generate context files, and help craft contributor profiles & AI guidance systems
* **Design the System** — Help establish governance rules, licensing terms, and the mission assignment engine
* **Spread the Word** — Recruit collaborators, educators, and mission leads

> 🛠️ All contributions during Phase 0 are **credited**, tracked for future **reputation rewards**, and foundational to the Guild's direction.
