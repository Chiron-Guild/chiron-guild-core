# Chiron Guild 🛡️🤖

**AI-Augmented Guilds for Collective Intelligence & Worker Empowerment**

Chiron Guild is a community-driven platform that transforms how complex projects are tackled—through human + AI collaboration, mission-based work, and equitable participation. We're building a system that empowers contributors, learners, and freelancers while protecting against exploitative commercial use.

## 🚀 What We’re Building

A platform that:
- Accepts large, complex projects from clients or community needs
- Uses **AI + human processes** to break them into missions
- Enables contributors to **learn, earn, and grow** through structured, gamified collaboration
- Transparently documents how **AI tools and humans interact** throughout the project lifecycle
- Builds toward a **self-assembling, community-owned system** of collective intelligence

## 🧠 Mythic Core, Professional Shell

While our tone is outwardly professional, the spirit is inspired by sci-fi and video games. We're building something bold—a modern guild system where reputation, mastery, and collaboration matter.

## 🚧 Phase 0: Founding Missions

We’re in **Phase 0: the Bootstrapping Era** of Chiron Guild.

Our first "client project" is to **build Chiron Guild itself**—the tools, workflows, governance, and documentation that will power future projects.

### 🔥 How You Can Help Right Now

- **Shape the Platform** — Help design workflows, prompts, and infrastructure.
- **Build the Tools** — Contribute code, templates, and project management tools.

- **Design the System** — Contribute to governance rules, licensing terms, and the mission assignment engine.
