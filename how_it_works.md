How Our Program Works: A Simple Guide
Feeling like you have more to offer but aren't sure how to get the skills you need for today's job market? Our community is designed to help you grow your skills and build a powerful portfolio by working on real projects, all while being part of a supportive team.
Here’s a simple, step-by-step method for how you can get started and grow with us.
Step 1: Join Our Community & Find a Project
First, you become a member of our community, giving you access to our Project Board. Here, you can find a variety of projects that our community is working on. Each one has a clear Project Guide that explains its goals. You can pick a project that interests you and fits the skills you want to learn.
Step 2: Complete the Project with Support
You’re never alone. Every project comes with the guidance and resources you need to succeed. As you work on your project, you’ll be learning new things and applying them in a hands-on, practical way. Our community is always available to help answer questions and offer support.
Step 3: Share Your Work with the Community
Once you’ve completed a project, you’ll share it with the community. This isn’t a scary test! It’s a supportive process where other members can see your great work and provide helpful feedback. This helps everyone learn and ensures we’re all doing our best.
Step 4: Earn a Verified Accomplishment
After your project is reviewed, you earn a Verified Accomplishment. This is more than just a gold star—it’s a permanent, trustworthy record of the specific skills you demonstrated and the real work you completed.
What You Get as a Member
As you complete projects, you build a Portfolio of Your Work. This portfolio is filled with your Verified Accomplishments, creating a powerful and trustworthy showcase of your skills that you can share with anyone.
And because we are a cooperative, our community is built on a model of How We Share Success. When our collective work creates financial value, that success is shared fairly among the members who contributed to it.
Our Promise to You
We are guided by a few core promises to our members:
 * You Own Your Work: You always have ownership and control over your contributions.
 * A Place for Everyone: We provide projects for all skill levels, so you can start contributing and growing from day one.
