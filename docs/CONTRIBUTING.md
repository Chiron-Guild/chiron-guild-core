# CONTRIBUTING to Chiron Guild üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

**Initiation Protocols for the AI-Augmented Architect. Forge the New Order.**

Welcome, future Guild Operative. You are at the threshold of a new digital frontier. This document contains the critical protocols for your initiation into Chiron Guild, detailing how you will arm yourself, execute **Guild Ops**, and become an "AI-augmented super worker" by actively forging the very bedrock of our collective.

---

## 1. Our Prime Directive: Self-Assembly (Phase 0: The Bootstrapping Era)

Chiron Guild is not just a platform; it is a declaration of war against obsolescence. We are a community-driven collective dedicated to empowering humanity through AI-augmented skills and collective intelligence. Our most crucial "client contract" right now is **Chiron Guild itself.**

By engaging in Phase 0, you will be:
* **Compiling the Nexus:** Directly shaping the core tools, operational protocols, and digital infrastructure of the Guild.
* **Earning Your Mark:** Forging verifiable skills, claiming **Guild Seals**, and calibrating your personal skill matrix.
* **Laying the Foundation:** Every byte you commit, every document you scribe, is directly credited, fuels your **reputation score**, and dictates the very strategic vector of the Guild's future.

## 2. Access Protocols: Arming Your Station

We operate with precision and transparency across key digital domains. This is your initial access point:

1.  **Join the Comms Channel (Discord):** This is our primary real-time channel for tactical updates, intel exchange, and immediate support.
    * **Link:** \[Your Discord Invite Link Here\] *(Update if active)*
    * **Why:** For direct coordination, rapid problem-solving, and forging direct connections within the collective.
2.  **Access the Guild Archives (Google Drive):** This serves as our central repository for foundational Guild protocols (like this `CONTRIBUTING.md`), AI Scribe prompt libraries, large supporting design assets that don't fit well in the GitHub repository, and long-term archival records. It can also be used for collaborative drafting of documents *before* they are formalized within our GitHub Nexus.
    * **Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPKYI5OU5X2vzKhBdlRFHp475VV25qqV?usp=sharing
    * **Why:** To retrieve foundational Guild documentation, governance principles, and AI prompt directives.
3.  **Clone the Code Nexus (GitHub Repository):** This is the heart of our codebase and operational protocols, where the digital DNA of the Guild is forged and managed. Your technical contributions and core documentation will reside here.
    * **Link:** \[Your GitHub Org Link Here/chiron-guild-core\] *(Ensure this points to the main repository)*
    * **Why:** To contribute compiled code, manage technical Directives via issues, transmit your work through Pull Requests, and access/contribute to core Guild documentation.

## 3. Executing Your Guild Op: The Path to Augmentation

All contributions within Chiron Guild are structured as **Guild Ops**‚Äîprecision-engineered tasks that advance the collective while sharpening your augmented capabilities.

1.  **Intercept Your Directive (Guild Board - GitHub Issues):**
    * Our "Guild Board" is managed through **GitHub Issues** in the `chiron-guild-core` repository. Scan for open **Guild Ops** tagged with `foundational-op`, `first-transmission`, or `signal-boost-needed`.
    * Each Directive (GitHub Issue) *is* the **Guild Op Brief**. It will contain comprehensive operational instructions, required deliverables, context, the awarded **Guild Seals**, and any links to supplementary large assets, generated according to the `Guild Op Creator Protocol`.
    * **Link:** \[Your GitHub Issues Link Here, e.g., https://github.com/Chiron-Guild/chiron-guild-core/issues\]

2.  **Execute the Work (AI-Augmented Precision!):**
    * Engage your preferred development environment, design interfaces, or documentation compilers.
    * **Leverage AI Tools:** Adhere to the guidance provided in the Guild Op Brief (GitHub Issue) and our **AI Scribe Prompts** (located in the Guild Archives or repository) to deploy your own external LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, local models). Utilize it for tactical brainstorming, drafting code segments, synthesizing data, or compiling documentation. This symbiotic human-AI augmentation is the core of our power.

3.  **Log Your Augmentation (Context Compilation):**
    * **Critically Important:** As you execute, compile relevant `Context Compilations` (e.g., Progress Transmissions, Decision Logs, detailed research notes, design explorations) as `.md` documents.
    * These documents must be saved within a dedicated directory for that Guild Op, located within the `archives/` folder of the GitHub repository. This directory will share the same ID and title as the Guild Op Issue (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DEV-001_Develop_User_Auth_Module]/`). *(Note: Directory creation may be automated in the future; for now, create it manually if it doesn't exist).*
    * **Post regular summaries and direct links** to these `.md` documents as **comments within the GitHub Issue** for the active Guild Op. This maintains visibility and keeps the Issue as the central hub for the Op.
    * **Always human-review and refine** any AI-generated content for accuracy, clarity, and consistency with Guild protocols.

## 4. Transmitting Your Contribution

When your Guild Op is complete, initiate transmission:

1.  **For Code Compilations:**
    * **Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:**
        * Ensure your branch is synchronized with the `main` operational vector.
        * Link your PR directly to the original GitHub Issue (Guild Op).
        * Provide a clear summary of your compiled changes in the PR description.
        * Reference any supporting `Context Compilations` or design documents (e.g., `Code_Overview.md`, `Decision_Log.md`) located in the Guild Op's dedicated directory (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DEV-001_Develop_User_Auth_Module]/`) by linking to them in your PR description.
2.  **For Non-Code Compilations (Documentation, Design, Protocols):**
    * Ensure all relevant deliverable documents (e.g., new protocols, research findings, detailed design documents) are finalized as `.md` files (or other appropriate formats) and saved within the Guild Op's dedicated directory in the GitHub repository (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DOC-002_Refine_Onboarding_Protocol]/`).
    * Commit and push these files. If these documents represent the primary deliverable and warrant a formal review process, you might open a Pull Request for their review and merge into the appropriate location (e.g., `/protocols` or `/docs`).
    * Return to the original **GitHub Issue** for the Guild Op. Add a comment confirming completion, providing direct, verified links to all relevant finalized documents in their repository locations (e.g., within the `archives/[GuildOpID]/` directory or their final merged path).
    * If specific supplementary assets *must* reside in Google Drive (e.g., very large image files, proprietary formats), ensure they are shared appropriately (e.g., with `thechironguild@gmail.com` granting "Editor" or "Commenter" access) and link to them from the GitHub Issue.

---

## 5. Verification & Commendation (Guild Seals)

* Your transmission will undergo rigorous review by Guild Facilitators and/or peer operatives. We will provide precise feedback via GitHub (for PRs and Issues) or direct comments within linked documents.
* Upon successful verification and approval, your contribution will be integrated (if code/docs), and you will be awarded the associated **"Guild Seal"** on your Chiron Guild profile‚Äîa permanent mark of your earned standing.

---

## 6. Guild Axioms: Our Code

* **Own What You Forge** ‚Äî Contributors retain full digital sovereignty over their compiled work and data within the Guild.
* **Open Access, Earned Value** ‚Äî Structured Guild Ops provide pathways for all skill levels to engage, augment their capabilities, and secure equitable value for their contributions.
* **Transparent Augmentation** ‚Äî All AI contributions are meticulously logged, visible, and subjected to rigorous human oversight.
* **Collective Authority** ‚Äî Guild decisions and strategic vectors are shaped by the collective will of its members, not by distant algorithms or corporate command.
