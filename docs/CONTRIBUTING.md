# Contributing to the Chiron Guild: Your Path as an Operative üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

**Welcome, Valued Operative. You stand at the frontier of a new collaborative endeavor. This guide outlines the protocols for engaging with the Chiron Guild, contributing your unique talents, and helping to forge a more equitable and empowered future of work.**

To fully understand the vision that guides us, please first familiarize yourself with [The Chiron Guild: A Manifesto for a New Reality](docs/Guild_Manifesto.md).

## 1. Our Collective Mission: Self-Assembly in Phase 0

The Chiron Guild is more than a platform; it is a living testament to the power of collective creation. We are currently in **Phase 0: The Bootstrapping Era**. Our primary objective is the **self-assembly of the Guild itself**‚Äîits core infrastructure, operational protocols, and the very tools that will empower future endeavors.

As an Operative in Phase 0, your contributions are foundational. You will be:
* **Architecting the Future:** Directly shaping the digital and conceptual framework of our cooperative.
* **Earning Your Standing:** Building your `Reputation Matrix` through verifiable skills demonstrated in completed `Guild Ops` and recognized with `Guild Seals`.
* **Laying the Keel:** Every contribution‚Äîcode compiled, documentation scribed, protocol refined‚Äîis a vital component in the construction of our shared vessel, charting the course for all Chironians.

## 2. Orienting Yourself: Key Access Points & Resources

To effectively navigate and contribute, familiarize yourself with these essential elements of the Chiron Guild Hub:

1.  **Join Our Comms Channel (Discord):** This is our primary channel for real-time discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and fostering our community.
    * **Link:** \[Your Discord Invite Link Here\] *(Please update if active)*
    * **Purpose:** For direct coordination, sharing insights, and building connections within the Guild.
2.  **Consult the Guild Archives (Google Drive - Legacy & Specific Assets):** While our active operational documents reside within the GitHub repository, Google Drive serves as a repository for some foundational Guild protocols, historical AI Scribe prompt libraries, and large supplementary assets (e.g., non-Markdown design files, extensive datasets).
    * **Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPKYI5OU5X2vzKhBdlRFHp475VV25qqV?usp=sharing
    * **Purpose:** To access specific foundational documents or large assets referenced in `Guild Op Briefs`.
3.  **Engage with the Chiron Guild Hub (Primary GitHub Repository):** This is the heart of our development, documentation, and operational management.
    * **Link:** \[Your GitHub Org Link Here/chiron-guild-core\] *(Ensure this points to the main repository)*
    * **Purpose:** To access `Guild Op Briefs` (via Issues), contribute code and documentation, submit your work via Pull Requests, and collaborate on evolving Guild protocols.

## 3. Your Journey as an Operative: Executing Guild Ops

All contributions to the Chiron Guild are structured as **Guild Ops**‚Äîclearly defined initiatives that advance our collective goals while providing opportunities for you to apply and enhance your skills.

1.  **Select Your Guild Op (via the Guild Board - GitHub Issues):**
    * Our "Guild Board" is managed through **GitHub Issues** within the Chiron Guild Hub. Browse for available `Guild Ops`, paying attention to tags like `phase0-priority`, `skill-focus:[your-skill]`, or `help-welcomed`.
    * Each GitHub Issue *is* the **Guild Op Brief**. It contains a comprehensive description of the objective, required deliverables, relevant context, the `Guild Seals` awarded upon successful completion, and links to any supplementary materials. These briefs are generated according to the `Copilot_Issue_Creation_Protocol.md`.
    * **Link to Guild Board:** \[Your GitHub Issues Link Here, e.g., https://github.com/Chiron-Guild/chiron-guild-core/issues\]

2.  **Execute Your Op (Leveraging AI Augmentation):**
    * Engage your preferred development environment, design tools, or documentation platforms.
    * **Embrace AI Augmentation:** As guided by the `Guild Op Brief` and our **AI Scribe Prompts** (accessible within the Chiron Guild Hub or linked Guild Archives), utilize your chosen external LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). Employ these tools for research, drafting, code generation, data analysis, and refining your `Context Compilations`. This synergy between human expertise and AI capability is central to the Guild's philosophy.

3.  **Document Your Progress (Context Compilation):**
    * **Essential Practice:** As you execute your `Guild Op`, meticulously compile relevant `Context Compilations`‚Äîsuch as progress updates, decision logs, detailed research findings, or design explorations‚Äîas `.md` documents.
    * These documents must be saved within a dedicated directory for that `Guild Op`, located within the `archives/` folder of the Chiron Guild Hub. This directory should be named to correspond with the Guild Op (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DEV-001_Develop_User_Auth_Module]/`). *(Note: Directory creation may be automated in the future; for now, please create it manually if it doesn't exist).*
    * **Maintain Transparency:** Post regular summaries and direct links to these `.md` documents as **comments within the GitHub Issue** for your active `Guild Op`. This ensures visibility and keeps the Issue as the central reference point.
    * **Human Calibration:** Always critically review, refine, and verify any AI-generated content for accuracy, clarity, and alignment with Guild standards and the specific Op requirements.

## 4. Submitting Your Completed Work

Once your `Guild Op` deliverables are complete:

1.  **For Code-Based Contributions:**
    * **Initiate a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:**
        * Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the `main` (or relevant development) branch.
        * Clearly link your PR to the original GitHub Issue (the `Guild Op`).
        * Provide a comprehensive summary of the changes and their purpose in the PR description.
        * In your PR description, reference and link to any supporting `Context Compilations` (e.g., `Technical_Overview.md`, `Testing_Strategy.md`) located in the Guild Op's dedicated directory (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DEV-001_Develop_User_Auth_Module]/`).
2.  **For Documentation, Design, or Protocol Contributions:**
    * Ensure all deliverable documents (e.g., new protocols, research papers, comprehensive design specifications) are finalized as `.md` files (or other suitable formats) and saved within the Guild Op's dedicated directory in the Chiron Guild Hub (e.g., `archives/[CHIRON-DOC-002_Refine_Onboarding_Protocol]/`).
    * Commit and push these files. If these documents represent a primary deliverable intended for broader Guild adoption (like a new or revised protocol), a Pull Request should be opened for their review and merge into the appropriate main directory (e.g., `/protocols` or `/docs`).
    * Return to the original **GitHub Issue** for the `Guild Op`. Add a comment confirming completion, providing direct links to all finalized documents in their repository locations (e.g., within the `archives/[GuildOpID]/` directory or their final merged path).
    * If essential supplementary assets must reside in Google Drive (e.g., very large media files), ensure they are appropriately shared and clearly linked from the GitHub Issue.

## 5. Verification and Recognition (Guild Seals)

* Your submitted work will be reviewed by Guild Facilitators and/or fellow Operatives, guided by principles of constructive feedback and shared standards. Feedback will be provided via GitHub (for PRs and Issues) or through comments on linked documents.
* Upon successful verification and approval, your contribution will be integrated, and you will be awarded the associated **`Guild Seal`**. This will be recorded in your `Reputation Matrix`, serving as a lasting testament to your skills and contributions to the Guild.

## 6. Core Principles of Contribution (Our Axioms)

* **Ownership & Sovereignty:** Operatives retain appropriate rights and digital sovereignty over their unique contributions, as defined by our Guild license and cooperative agreements.
* **Opportunity & Earned Value:** Structured `Guild Ops` provide clear pathways for Operatives of all skill levels to engage, develop their capabilities, and receive equitable recognition and value for their contributions.
* **Transparent Augmentation:** All significant uses of AI in generating deliverables are to be acknowledged, ensuring our processes remain transparent and human-calibrated.
* **Collective Governance:** The strategic direction and operational evolution of the Guild are shaped by the collective wisdom and participation of its members.
