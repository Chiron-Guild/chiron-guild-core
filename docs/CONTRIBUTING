# CONTRIBUTING to Chiron Guild üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

Welcome, future Guild member! We're thrilled you're considering contributing to Chiron Guild. This document outlines everything you need to get started and become an "AI-augmented super worker" by helping us build the very foundation of the Guild.

## 1. Our Current Mission: Building the Guild Itself (Phase 0: The Bootstrapping Era)

Chiron Guild is a community-driven project dedicated to empowering individuals through AI-augmented skills and collective intelligence. Right now, our most important "client project" is **Chiron Guild itself.**

By contributing in Phase 0, you'll be:
*   **Shaping the Platform:** Designing the core tools, workflows, and infrastructure.
*   **Gaining Verifiable Skills:** Earning "Merit Badges" and building your personal skill portfolio.
*   **Foundational to the Guild:** All contributions are credited, tracked for future reputation rewards, and directly influence the Guild's direction.

## 2. Join the Guild! Your First Steps

We operate transparently and collaboratively across a few key platforms:

1.  **Join our Discord Server:** This is our primary real-time communication hub.
    *   **Link:** [Your Discord Invite Link Here]
    *   **Why:** For discussions, real-time help, community updates, and informal brainstorming.
2.  **Explore the Google Drive Knowledge Base:** This is our central repository for project documentation, guidelines, and the AI Documentation Assistant.
    *   **Link:** [Your Google Drive Public Share Link Here]
    *   **Why:** To access detailed mission briefs, design docs, governance principles, and our AI prompts.
3.  **Fork our GitHub Repository:** This is where all the code for the platform lives, and where you'll submit your technical contributions.
    *   **Link:** [Your GitHub Org Link Here]
    *   **Why:** To contribute code, manage technical tasks via issues, and submit Pull Requests (PRs).

## 3. How to Find & Work on a Mission

All contributions in Chiron Guild are structured as "Skill Missions"‚Äîbite-sized tasks that contribute to the overall project while helping you gain new skills.

1.  **Browse the Guild Board (GitHub Issues):**
    *   Our "Guild Board" is managed through **GitHub Issues**. Look for issues tagged with `skill-mission`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted`.
    *   Each issue will contain a brief description of the task, its estimated effort, and the "Merit Badges" associated with its completion.
    *   **Link:** [Your GitHub Issues Link Here]

2.  **Understand the Mission:**
    *   Once you've chosen a mission from GitHub Issues, the issue description will link to a **detailed Mission Brief in Google Drive**. This document (e.g., `Platform Self-Assembly/Skill Missions/MS001 - Mission Title/Mission Brief - MS001.gdoc`) will contain:
        *   Comprehensive instructions.
        *   Required deliverables.
        *   Links to any supporting documentation (e.g., design mockups, API specs).
        *   Specific prompts and guidelines for using **external AI tools** for assistance.

3.  **Perform the Work (AI-Augmented!):**
    *   Use your preferred development environment, design tools, or writing applications.
    *   **Leverage AI tools:** Follow the guidance provided in the Mission Brief and our **AI Documentation Assistant Prompts** (found in Google Drive) to use your own external LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, local models) to assist with brainstorming, drafting, coding, or summarizing. This is a core part of becoming an "AI-augmented super worker"!

4.  **Document Your Workflow (Context Building):**
    *   **Critically Important:** As you work, generate relevant documentation using our **AI Documentation Assistant Prompts**. This includes:
        *   **Progress Summaries:** What did you do, challenges, next steps.
        *   **Decision Logs:** Key choices made and their rationale.
        *   **Code/Design Overviews:** Explanations of new components.
    *   **Always human-review and refine** AI-generated content for accuracy and clarity.
    *   Save these `.md` documents in the designated folders within our **Google Drive** (as specified in `Appendix F` and the Mission Brief).

## 4. Submitting Your Contribution

When your mission is complete:

1.  **For Code Contributions:**
    *   **Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:**
        *   Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main`.
        *   Link your PR to the original GitHub Issue.
        *   Provide a clear description of your changes.
        *   Reference any supporting documentation in Google Drive (e.g., `MS001_Code_Overview_YourName.md`).
2.  **For Non-Code Contributions (Documentation, Design, Workflows):**
    *   Ensure all relevant documents are finalized and saved in the correct **Google Drive** locations.
    *   If you created new documents, **share them with `thechironguild@gmail.com`** giving **"Editor"** access, or **"Commenter"** access if you prefer to retain ownership.
    *   Go back to the original **GitHub Issue** for the mission. Add a comment indicating completion and provide direct links to all relevant Google Drive documents.

## 5. Review & Recognition (Merit Badges)

*   Your submission will be reviewed by Guild Facilitators and/or peers. We'll provide constructive feedback via GitHub (for PRs) or comments in Google Docs.
*   Once approved, your contribution will be merged (if code) and you will be awarded the associated **"Merit Badge"** on your Chiron Guild profile.

## 6. Core Principles for Contributors

*   **Own What You Create:** You retain rights to your individual work and data contributed to the Guild. Our community license will reflect this.
*   **Open Learning, Fair Value:** Structured missions allow all skill levels to contribute, learn, and earn reputation.
*   **Transparent AI Use:** Always document when and how you've used AI tools, and ensure human review of AI-generated content.
*   **Community Governance:** Contribute to discussions on Discord and GitHub to help shape the Guild's future.
