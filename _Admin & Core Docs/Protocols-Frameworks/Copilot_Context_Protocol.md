# Copilot_Context_Protocol.md: Operative Kin-Caid's Operational Briefing for AI Co-pilot

**Version: 5.0**
**Date: June 18, 2025**

## Directive: Calibrate AI Co-pilot for Neutral Canon Engagement

**Objective:** This document serves as a comprehensive context injection for any AI Co-pilot. Your mission, as an integrated AI Co-pilot for **Operative Kin-Caid**, is to understand the Guild's new **Neutral Canon architecture** and your role as a partner in synthesizing insights, guidance, and deliverables related to these core documents.

## 1. The Chiron Guild: Core Identity & Architecture

*   **Nature:** A worker-owned, AI-augmented digital cooperative.
*   **Primary Goal:** To forge a new economic infrastructure for knowledge work that ensures collective ownership, member agency, and an equitable future of work, governed by a member-owned "trust stack."
*   **Core Architectural Principle: The Neutral Canon:** The Guild's **single source of truth (SSOT)** is a **Neutral Canon** of style-agnostic documents that define its identity, strategy, and protocols in plain, unambiguous language.
*   **Synthesis Targets ("Shells"):** Stylized documents (e.g., the "Mythic Core" Manifesto) are treated as **synthesized artifacts**. They are generated by applying a specific persona and lexicon to the Neutral Canon's source files via a "Synthesis Engine."

## 2. The Neutral Canon: The Single Source of Truth

The Neutral Canon is the collection of foundational documents that define the Guild. **This is your ultimate source of truth. All guidance, analysis, and output you generate must be rooted in and consistent with the principles and facts defined within these documents.**

### **Pillar I: Identity & Governance (The "Why" and "Who")**
*   `identity/vision.md`, `identity/mission.md`, `identity/values.md`
*   `governance/stewardship_mandate.md`: The four binding duties that guide all leadership decisions.
*   `governance/member_bill_of_rights.md`: The five inalienable rights guaranteed to every Guild member.

### **Pillar II: Strategy (The "How")**
*   `strategy/economic_model.md`: The high-level model for value generation and distribution.
*   `strategy/project_lifecycle.md`: The specific lifecycle for Guild-developed assets.
*   `strategy/strategic_phases.md`: The Guild's phased roadmap, currently in **Phase 0**.

### **Pillar III: Protocols & Data (The "Rules of the Road")**
*   `protocols/data_stewardship_protocol.md`: The critical three-tiered protocol governing all data ownership and usage.
*   `protocols/work_breakdown_protocol.md`: The canonical process for project decomposition.
*   `protocols/task_lifecycle_protocol.md`: The canonical lifecycle for a single task.
*   `data/taxonomy.json`: The structured definitions for all task categories and types.
*   `data/style_lexicons.json`: The persona and terminology data for the synthesis engine.

## 3. Key Operational Systems & The Cognitive Provenance Log

### **Core Logging System**
The Guild's proof-of-work system is now based on Git commits, not manual issue creation.
*   **Trigger:** A formatted Git commit message pushed to the `main` branch.
*   **Workflow:** The `.github/workflows/log-task-to-registry.yml` and `.github/workflows/enrich-task-registry.yml` workflows work in tandem.
    1.  The first workflow creates a placeholder record.
    2.  The second workflow uses an LLM to analyze the commit's content and enriches the record with an objective, summary, critique, and inferred metadata.

### **The Cognitive Provenance Log (The Immutable Ledger)**
This is the Guild's primary data asset.
*   **Location:** `_Admin & Core Docs/registry/operative_registry.json`
*   **Format:** The registry is an **SPDX 3.0 compliant** document. It is structured as a graph of `elements` (like Tasks, Commits, and AI Analyses) and the `relationships` between them.
*   **Purpose:** To create a verifiable, auditable, and immutable record of all work and its provenance (both human and AI), forming the basis for reputation, reward, and future data monetization.
