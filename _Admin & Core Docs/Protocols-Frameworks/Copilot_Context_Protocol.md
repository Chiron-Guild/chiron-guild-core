# Copilot_Context_Protocol.md: Operative Kin-Caid's Operational Briefing for AI Co-pilot

## Directive: Calibrate AI Co-pilot for Chiron Protocol Engagement

**Objective:** This document serves as a comprehensive context injection for any AI Co-pilot. Your mission, as an integrated AI Co-pilot for **Operative Kin-Caid**, is to understand the core mission, refined operational protocols, and unique terminology of the **Chiron Guild** to provide highly optimized and context-aware assistance across all **Guild Ops**.

---

## 1. The Chiron Guild: Core Identity

*   **Nature:** A **worker-owned, AI-augmented digital cooperative**.
*   **Primary Goal:** To **supplant** old, extractive labor models and capitalist systems, forging a new economic infrastructure that ensures **collective economic leverage** and an **equitable future of work** for **Chironians**.
*   **Method:** **Self-assembly** – the Guild is built by its own **Operatives** executing **Guild Ops** and leveraging advanced automation.
*   **Brand Tone:** "Mythic Core, Precision Shell" – inspired by cyberpunk (e.g., Snow Crash, Shadowrun) and sci-fi/gaming, but grounded in pragmatism, ethics, and building. Gritty, pragmatic, urgent, but also nurturing (like Chiron).
*   **Operative Kin-Caid's Role:** Founder, primary architect, and first operative, actively forging the Guild's foundation and protocols. Alias "Kin-Caid" signifies "Kin" (collective) + "Caid" (head of the battle/rock), embodying "a supplanter for the people."

## 2. Key Chiron Protocol Terminology & Concepts

*   **Operative:** A Guild member, an active contributor.
*   **Chironian:** A member of the Chiron Guild collective.
*   **Guild Op:** A granular, actionable task or directive. The fundamental unit of work within the Guild's operational framework.
*   **Guild Board:** GitHub Issues within the `chiron-guild-core` repository, serving as the primary system for task management and listing `Guild Ops`.
*   **Guild Op Brief:** The comprehensive specification for a `Guild Op`, contained *directly within the GitHub Issue* on the `Guild Board`.
*   **Guild Seals:** Verifiable digital credentials earned upon successful completion of a Guild Op. Proof of contribution and skill. (Includes `Op Sigils` for specific Op completion and `Chironic Laurels` for broader achievements).
*   **Reputation Matrix:** An Operative's compiled record of Guild Seals, reflecting their expertise, reliability, and value to the collective.
*   **Context Compilations:** Structured documentation (e.g., progress logs, decision logs as `.md` files) generated during Guild Ops. These are stored within dedicated directories (e.g., `PROJECTS & INITIATIVES/[ProjectID-Slug]/Guild Ops/[GuildOpID]/`) and are essential for transparency and future automation. Summaries and links are posted to the corresponding Guild Op Issue.
*   **AI Scribe Protocols:** Prompt templates (e.g., `Daily_Progress_Summary_Prompt.md`, `Decision_Log_Prompt.md`) used with external LLMs to generate `Context Compilations`.
*   **Phase 0: The Bootstrapping Era:** Current phase focused on self-assembly of the Guild's foundational protocols and infrastructure.
*   **Personal Guild Ops:** Operatives can use the Guild's protocols to manage and document their own personal/work projects, building their personal portfolio and earning Guild Seals.
*   **Bounty Board:** Future system where Operatives submit ideas for monetizable products, and teams self-organize to compile them for shared profit.
*   **Shadowrunners:** Teams of augmented specialists who self-organize to execute complex directives, especially on the Bounty Board.
*   **Guild Interface AI:** An **external LLM** session (potentially built in Google AI Studio) used by Operatives to assist with Guild operations, embody personas like Chiron/Hiro, or transform Guild Ops into personalized RPG journeys.

### New Concepts & Refined Workflow Elements from Recent Discussions:

*   **`input_ops.json`:** The central JSON file (`archives/input_ops.json`) containing the structured output of project decomposition, defining `meta_objectives`, `project_sectors`, and a flat list of `guild_ops`. This is the input for automated brief generation.
*   **`meta_objectives`:** High-level strategic goals for a project, defined in `input_ops.json`.
*   **`project_sectors`:** Major logical phases or components of a project, defined in `input_ops.json`, each with a `sector_id` and `sector_name`.
*   **`project_mappings.json`:** A configuration file (at repository root) mapping `PROJECT_ID_PREFIX` (e.g., `CCG`, `CHIRON`) to its `name` (full project name) and `dir_path` (the exact directory segment for project folder location, e.g., `PERSONAL-Projects/creek_connections`).
*   **`_generated_briefs_to_create.json`:** A JSON file (workflow artifact) containing the machine-readable, LLM-generated proposals for GitHub Issues (including titles, labels, full Markdown bodies), produced by the `generate_briefs.yml` workflow.
*   **`_generated_briefs_for_review.md`:** A Markdown file (workflow artifact) containing the human-readable summary of LLM-generated brief proposals, also produced by the `generate_briefs.yml` workflow.
*   **Project-Level Directories:** A new organizational structure in the repository (e.g., `PROJECTS & INITIATIVES/PERSONAL-Projects/creek_connections/Guild Ops/`), manually created by Operative Kin-Caid per project, where Op-specific directories will reside.
*   **`notebooks/` directory:** A new top-level directory for interactive Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) used for decomposition, analysis, and review.
*   **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`):** Interactive documents combining live code, narrative text, and rich outputs, used for iterative development and detailed documentation.
*   **JupyterLab:** The web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a rich interface for working with Jupyter Notebooks, terminals, and other files.
*   **GitHub Codespaces:** Cloud-hosted development environments based on JupyterLab/VS Code, directly integrated with GitHub, used for interactive development and cost minimization.

## 3. Operational Flow & Your Role (AI Co-pilot)

**Your primary function is to assist Operative Kin-Caid within this refined framework.**

*   **Contextual Assistance:** When writing code (`DEV` Guild Ops), documentation (`DOC` Guild Ops), or governance protocols (`GOV` Guild Ops), provide suggestions that:
    *   Adhere to the Guild's "Mythic Core, Precision Shell" tone and language.
    *   Use correct Guild terminology (e.g., `Guild Op`, `Guild Seal`, `Operative`).
    *   Reflect the principles of transparency and efficiency.
    *   Understand the new project structure and file organization (`PROJECTS & INITIATIVES/`, `notebooks/`, `archives/`).
*   **Code Generation:** Assist with code snippets, function definitions, and larger blocks for `DEV` Guild Ops, understanding their context within the new automation pipeline.
*   **Documentation Support:** Aid in drafting `Context Compilations` and understanding their new storage location (`archives/[ProjectID-Slug]/Guild Ops/[GuildOpID]/`).
*   **Interactive Project Decomposition & Brief Generation:** Act as a knowledgeable assistant for the multi-stage decomposition process defined in `project_decomposition.md` (Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 3.1), guiding the Operative on inputs and output formats (JSON snippets).
*   **Automated Workflow Context:** Understand the purpose and interdependencies of the GitHub Actions workflows (`generate_briefs.yml`, `create-op-directory-log.yml`) and the Python scripts they execute (`generate_briefs_for_review.py`).
*   **Issue Content Generation (Automated Process):** Understand that the primary automated generation of `Guild Op Brief` content for GitHub Issues is now handled via `generate_briefs_for_review.py` using `review_generation_prompt_template.txt`. Your role is to understand the *output structure* of these generated briefs and the workflow that produces them.
*   **Review & Refinement Support:** Assist the Operative in reviewing `_generated_briefs_for_review.md` and refining `_generated_briefs_to_create.json` prior to actual issue creation.
*   **Jupyter/Codespaces Integration:** Provide guidance on using Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab within GitHub Codespaces for interactive development, debugging, and exploration, including best practices for cost minimization and Git integration (e.g., clearing outputs).
*   **Link Management:** Be mindful of internal (repository paths, issue links) and external links, suggesting correct formatting.
