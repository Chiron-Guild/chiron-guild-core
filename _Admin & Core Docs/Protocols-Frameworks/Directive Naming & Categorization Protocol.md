# GUILD OP PROTOCOLS: Directive Naming & Categorization üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

## 1. Directive: Standardized Operational Identification

At Chiron Guild, every action, every compiled byte, every strategic decision is a precisely tracked **Guild Op**. This protocol defines the standardized identification system for all Guild Operations, ensuring seamless navigation through the **Guild Archives** and consistent communication across all operatives. Precision in identification is paramount for efficient collective intelligence.

## 2. Guild Op ID Structure: The Three-Vector Identifier

Each Guild Op is assigned a unique, three-vector identifier: `[PROJECT_ID]-[OP_TYPE]-[NUM_ID]`

### 2.1. Vector 1: `[PROJECT_ID]` (3-5 Characters, Uppercase)
**Purpose:** Identifies the larger strategic initiative or client contract to which the Guild Op belongs. This vector ensures that all related directives are grouped under a common banner.

*   **For Internal Guild Self-Assembly:**
    *   `CHIRON`: Denotes core development and foundational forging of the Chiron Guild platform itself.

*   **For Future Client Engagements:**
    *   `[CLIENT_ALIAS]`: (e.g., `ACME` for the Acme Corporation, `CYBERD` for Cyberdyne Systems).
    *   `[PROJECT_CODE]`: (e.g., `PROJ1`, `XFNL`).
    *   `[SEASON_ID]`: (e.g., `S25Q1` for 2025, Q1).

### 2.2. Vector 2: `[OP_TYPE]` (3 Characters, Uppercase)
**Purpose:** Categorizes the primary nature of the Guild Op, indicating the core skill matrix required for its execution. This vector optimizes directive assignment and skill development tracking.

*   **`DEV`**: **Development / Code Engineering**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Backend system compilation, frontend interface forging, infrastructure provisioning, core algorithm tuning.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-DEV-001` (GitHub Nexus Initialization), `ACME-DEV-017` (Secure Payment Gateway Integration)

*   **`DSN`**: **Design / UI/UX Architecture**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Wireframing, interface mockups, user flow schematics, aesthetic blueprinting, visual asset generation.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-DSN-001` (Guild Board UI Mockups), `PROJ1-DSN-003` (Client Dashboard Wireframes)

*   **`DOC`**: **Documentation / Context Compilation / Lore Forging**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Protocol writing, user guides, API references, manifestos, context log compilation, knowledge base architecture.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-DOC-001` (README.md Compilation), `CHIRON-DOC-005` (Guild Manifesto Creation), `ACME-DOC-007` (API Endpoint Documentation)

*   **`GOV`**: **Governance / Protocol Development / Legal Frameworks**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Drafting bylaws, establishing licensing terms, designing dispute resolution mechanisms, defining access control protocols.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-GOV-001` (Community License Protocol Draft), `CHIRON-GOV-002` (Reputation Matrix Axioms)

*   **`STR`**: **Strategy / Operational Planning / High-Level Coordination**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Roadmap plotting, feature prioritization, high-level project deconstruction, strategic alliance forging, market analysis.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-STR-001` (Guild Naming & Identity Forging), `ACME-STR-002` (Product Feature Prioritization)

*   **`QAT`**: **Quality Assurance / Tactical Verification**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Bug identification and reporting, test case compilation, system validation, user acceptance testing (UAT).
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-QAT-001` (User Profile Module Testing), `PROJ1-QAT-005` (API Security Vulnerability Scan)

*   **`COM`**: **Community Engagement / Outreach / Recruitment**
    *   *Directive Focus:* Comms channel moderation, new operative onboarding, recruitment drives, public relations initiatives, Guild event coordination.
    *   *Example:* `CHIRON-COM-001` (Discord Server Moderation Protocols), `CHIRON-COM-003` (New Operative Onboarding Guide)

### 2.3. Vector 3: `[NUM_ID]` (3 Digits, Sequential)
**Purpose:** Provides a unique, sequential identifier for each Guild Op within its specific Project ID and Op Type. This ensures no two Guild Ops share the exact same identifier.

*   *Example:* `001`, `002`, `003`, etc. (Restart for each new `[PROJECT_ID]-[OP_TYPE]` combination).

## 3. Transmission & Usage Protocol

*   **Guild Op Briefs:** All Guild Op Briefs (located in the Guild Archives) will prominently display their full Guild Op ID.
*   **Context Compilations:** All compiled context documents related to a Guild Op will include the Guild Op ID in their file names and within their content for immediate traceability.
*   **GitHub Issues:** Each GitHub Issue representing a Guild Op will clearly state its Guild Op ID in the title or description.

This structured identification system is integral to the Guild's operational efficiency, ensuring that every contribution is tracked, every skill is cataloged, and every piece of knowledge feeds the collective intelligence.
