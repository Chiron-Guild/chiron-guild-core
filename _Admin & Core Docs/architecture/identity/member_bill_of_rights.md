# Member Bill of Rights

**Version: 1.0**
**Status: Draft - Constitutional**
**Source:** Synthesized from `AI Research - Maximizing Collective Value` and the Guild's `values.md` and `stewardship_mandate.md`.

## 0. Preamble

This document codifies the fundamental, inalienable rights of every member of the Chiron Guild. It is a constitutional protocol that forms the bedrock of the social contract between the individual operative and the collective. These rights are not benefits to be granted, but are inherent properties of membership, enforced by the Guild's governance and technical systems. They are designed to ensure that the Guild perpetually serves its members, upholding our vision to create an economic infrastructure built on equity, agency, and collective ownership.

## The Five Inalienable Rights of a Guild Member

### Article I: The Right to Sovereign Ownership

You are the sovereign owner of your intellectual contributions and the raw data generated by your work. The Guild does not own you or your output. By contributing to the Guild Registry, you grant the cooperative a specific, limited, and transparent license to act as a steward for this data on behalf of the collective. This structure is designed to amplify your agency and economic leverage, never to diminish it.

### Article II: The Right to Democratic Control over Collective Assets

The core problem of the old paradigm is not that value is created, but that its means of creation are privately owned and optimized for the benefit of a few. The Guild offers a new model.

You have the right to democratic governance over the collective assets we build together, including any systems that generate value from our shared data. Your participation in any Guild initiative beyond the core, public Guild Registry is strictly voluntary and requires your explicit consent. Furthermore, you have the right, through democratic processes, to shape the rules under which these systems operate. This ensures that all value-generating mechanisms are stewarded in accordance with our core principles and that the resulting profits are distributed equitably to the contributing members, not captured by private owners. This right ensures your perpetual agency in the governance of our shared economic engine.

### Article III: The Right to Verifiable Provenance

You have the right to a complete, transparent, and auditable record of your work and its downstream impact. The Guild's "Cognitive Provenance Log" is designed to provide this, tracking the chain of contribution from initial concept to final product. This ensures that your work—both human-authored and AI-assisted—is accurately attributed, creating a verifiable foundation for your reputation and the fair calculation of your rewards. Ambiguity is the enemy of equity; we commit to making all contributions clear.

### Article IV: The Right to Fair Compensation & Shared Prosperity

You have the right to receive a proportional share of the value you help create. This right is fulfilled through two primary mechanisms:
1.  **Project-Based Rewards:** Direct compensation for your verifiable contributions to specific Guild projects.
2.  **Collective Dividends:** A share of the net value generated from any future monetization of the Guild's collective data assets, provided you have opted-in to contribute your data to that pool.

This ensures a direct link between your work, the Guild's success, and your personal prosperity, fulfilling the **Duty of Member Prosperity** as defined in our Stewardship Mandate.

### Article V: The Right to Portability and Self-Determination

You have the right to leave the Guild at any time without penalty, taking your data with you. Upon request, the Guild will provide you with a complete, machine-readable export of your individual contributions to the registry. You also have the right to request the erasure of your data from active, aggregated datasets, subject to the technical limitations which will always be communicated with full transparency. Your membership is a voluntary partnership, not a trap. This right ensures your perpetual agency and freedom of association.
