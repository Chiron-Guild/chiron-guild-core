# The Stewardship Mandate

The Guild rejects the principle of maximizing profit above all other considerations. In its place, we establish a Stewardship Mandate as the primary, binding obligation for all governing bodies and members in representative capacities. This mandate ensures the organization is managed in holistic service to its members and its mission, composed of four co-equal duties:


1.  **The Duty of Member Prosperity:**
To create and maintain systems that ensure the financial health, security, and equitable prosperity of the members. This includes securing fair compensation, ensuring transparent revenue distribution, and building collective funds that provide a robust social safety net.

2.  **The Duty of Member Growth and Agency:**
To foster an environment dedicated to the growth, mastery, and agency of every member. This duty obligates the organization to invest in its educational frameworks, maintain a fair system of verifiable accomplishment, and prioritize work that is meaningful and allows members to develop their skills.

3.  **The Duty to the Mission:**
To ensure that all activities of the organization remain in strict alignment with its publicly stated vision and mission. This duty serves as a permanent check against strategic drift that could compromise our core purpose.

4.  **The Duty of Collective Resilience:**
To responsibly manage the collective assets—both financial and intellectual—to ensure the long-term sustainability and independence of the organization. This includes maintaining a healthy treasury, investing in shared infrastructure, and making strategic decisions that benefit the entire cooperative.

**This mandate is put into practice through a set of canonical protocols, including the Project Asset Lifecycle.**
