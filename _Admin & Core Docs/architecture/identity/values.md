# Chiron Guild Values

The following principles are the foundational guide for all Guild operations, decisions, and interactions.

*   **Equity & Collective Ownership:** We believe that value should be owned and controlled by those who create it. Our structures and economic models prioritize equitable distribution, with rewards being calculated from an open and auditable record of each member's verifiable contributions. This ensures a direct link between proven work and shared ownership.

*   **Sovereignty & Agency:** We believe in empowering individuals. Our systems must be designed to enhance personal agency, data sovereignty, and self-determination, rather than creating dependency. Members should control their own contributions and data.

*   **Growth & Mastery:** We are a guild of craftspeople dedicated to perpetual learning. We commit to creating structured pathways for members of all skill levels to contribute meaningfully, develop new competencies, and achieve mastery in their chosen domains. We value the act of learning as a first-class contribution to the Guild's collective capability.

*   **Augmentation, Not Replacement:** We believe technology should serve human potential. We commit to developing and deploying AI and automation in ways that augment and amplify human creativity and strategic thinking, not replace them.

*   **Precision & Clarity:** We believe that ambiguity is the enemy of effective action. Our protocols, communications, and objectives must be defined with maximum clarity. We commit to meticulously tracking all contributions in a transparent record, making value creation explicit and understandable to all members.

*   **Stewardship of Collective Assets:** The core infrastructure we forge together is owned in perpetuity by the cooperative itself. This principle ensures that our core systems, our means of value creation, can never be sold, privatized, or leveraged against the interests of the members. They remain a permanent, shared asset, building lasting wealth and capability for the entire cooperative.
