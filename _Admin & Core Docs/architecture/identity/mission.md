# Chiron Guild Mission

Our mission is to build and operate a worker-owned, AI-augmented digital cooperative.

We achieve this through three primary activities:

1.  **Internal Self-Assembly:** 
First, we *build* the system that makes our values manifest. We use our own methodologies to systematically forge and refine the Guild's core engine: a transparent, verifiable, and permanent **Cognitive Provenance Log**. This process of building our own system of record serves as the primary mechanism for member skill development and the continuous improvement of our collective capabilities.

2. **Collective Value Creation:** 
Second, we *use* the system to perform collective work and generate value. In addition to undertaking consulting projects for external clients and partners, we leverage our pooled expertise to develop innovative, self-directed products and services. The success of these ventures generates revenue that is shared equitably among the contributing members and the cooperative itself, directly rewarding individual ingenuity while ensuring the continuous growth of our shared capabilities.

3.  **External Distribution:** Third, we *grow* the network to spread the system. We produce and distribute open-source frameworks and protocols that enable individuals and organizations outside the Guild to adopt our methodologies for their own productivity and organizational design.

This three-part mission—Build, Use, Grow—creates a self-reinforcing loop. Using the system provides the economic leverage, which proves the model's value, which in turn attracts more people through the distributed frameworks. This complete cycle provides a clear and effective pathway to **realizing our vision.**

Additionally, the mission functions as a strategic expression of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle for continuous improvement. We Build the system (Plan), Use it to create value (Do), Check the results of our work to find efficiencies (Check), and then Grow the network and refine our protocols based on those results (Act).
