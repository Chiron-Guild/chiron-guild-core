# Project Plan: Phase 0 - Foundation

This project plan translates the strategic goals of Phase 0 into an actionable framework.

### **Project Title:** Project Chiron: Phase 0 Foundation - The Personal Operating System

### **Project Goals & Objectives**
This project directly supports the **Mission** of "Internal Self-Assembly" by building the foundational engine for the Guild. It is the first concrete step toward realizing the **Vision** of a new economic infrastructure.

*   **Goal:** To establish a stable, repeatable, and valuable "Personal Operating System" for a solo knowledge worker, built upon the GitHub ecosystem.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  Implement a system for defining work with high clarity, fulfilling the value of **Precision & Clarity**.
    2.  Create an automated, verifiable "Cognitive Provenance Log" (the Registry), fulfilling **Article III: The Right to Verifiable Provenance**.
    3.  Package the system as a clean, forkable repository that can serve as the basis for Phase 1 community growth.
    4.  Produce the core documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) required for a new user to adopt the system for personal use.

### **Scope Statement**
*   **In Scope:**
    *   Functionality for a **single user** operating within their own forked repository.
    *   Creation of standardized GitHub Issue templates for task definition.
    *   A GitHub Action that automatically logs closed issues to a single Markdown file (`registry.md`).
    *   The `registry.md` file as the human-readable, canonical log of contributions.
    *   Basic documentation for setup and usage.
*   **Out of Scope (for Phase 0):**
    *   Multi-user collaboration features.
    *   Economic models (revenue sharing, client billing).
    *   Democratic governance mechanisms.
    *   The Tier 3 "Collective Analytics Dataset" and its associated opt-in logic.
    *   A dedicated user interface outside of the standard GitHub UI.

### **Key Deliverables**
1.  **Configured GitHub Repository Template:** A clean, forkable version of the framework.
2.  **GitHub Issue Templates:** A set of `.md` files defining structured formats for tasks.
3.  **`log-work-to-registry` GitHub Action:** A functional workflow script (`.yml`) that automates contribution logging.
4.  **`registry.md` file:** The initial, formatted registry file.
5.  **Core Documentation:** Completed `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.

### **High-Level Timeline & Milestones**
*   **M1: Framework Setup:** Repository structure finalized. Initial `registry.md` and documentation drafts created.
*   **M2: Task Definition:** Issue templates are designed and implemented, reflecting the core principles of clarity.
*   **M3: Automation Engine:** The `log-work-to-registry` GitHub Action is scripted, tested, and validated.
*   **M4: End-to-End Test:** A user can successfully fork the repo, create a task, close it, and see it automatically logged in the registry.
*   **M5: Launch:** The repository is declared "Phase 0 Complete" and ready for a solo user to adopt.

### **Key Stakeholders (for Phase 0)**
*   The Initial Creator / Core Developer(s) of the framework.

### **Resource Considerations (Conceptual)**
*   **Development:** Expertise in GitHub Actions (YAML), Git, and potentially light scripting (e.g., shell, Python) for the automation.
*   **Technical Writing:** Time dedicated to creating clear, concise documentation.

### **Success Metrics/KPIs**
*   **Primary Metric:** The system is successfully used by a solo user to manage and log 100% of their project tasks for one week, requiring zero manual edits to the `registry.md` file.
*   **Secondary Metric:** A new user can fork the repository and successfully log their first task within 30 minutes, based solely on the provided `README.md`.

### **Potential Risks & Assumptions**
*   **Risk:** The GitHub Actions automation becomes overly complex or hits unforeseen API limitations.
*   **Risk:** The desire to add Phase 1 features causes "scope creep," delaying the completion of a stable Phase 0.
*   **Assumption:** The target user has a working knowledge of Git and GitHub.
