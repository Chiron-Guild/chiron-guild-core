# Work Breakdown Protocol

**Objective:** To provide a standardized, AI-assisted process for decomposing a complex project concept into a formal Project Requirements Document (PRD) and a subsequent structured plan of actionable tasks.

This protocol consists of four primary stages that transform a high-level concept into a comprehensive and actionable project plan.

---

### **Stage 1: High level Scoping & Structuring**

*   **Goal:** To define the project's strategic objectives and its major functional components. This initial structure provides the raw material for a detailed analysis.
*   **Process:** The project's initial concept is analyzed, typically with AI assistance, to produce:
    1.  A set of 3-5 high-level Strategic Objectives.
    2.  A list of 3-5 major Project Phases (or Epics).
*   **Output:** A structured data file (e.g., JSON) containing the initial lists of objectives and phases.

### **Stage 2: Synthesize the Project Requirements Document (PRD)**

*   **Goal:** To create a single, comprehensive source of truth that formally defines the project's "why," "what," and "for whom."
*   **Process:** Using the structured data from Stage 1, an AI assistant (primed as a Senior Project Manager) synthesizes a complete PRD. This is a critical analysis step that includes:
    *   Distilling an Executive Summary and Problem Statement.
    *   Populating the defined Objectives and Phases.
    *   **Inferring and proposing essential details**, such as User Stories, Success Metrics (KPIs), Out-of-Scope items, and key Assumptions.
*   **Output:** A finalized, professional Project Requirements Document in Markdown format. This document becomes the definitive guide for the rest of the process.

### **Stage 3: Granular Task Identification**

*   **Goal:** To break down each project phase into a complete backlog of discrete, actionable tasks.
*   **Process:** With the finalized PRD from Stage 2 serving as the authoritative guide, each project phase is systematically decomposed into its constituent tasks. The PRD's detailed scope and user stories provide the necessary context to ensure all required work is identified.
*   **Output:** A comprehensive list of all tasks, with each task linked to its parent phase and defined with a title, type, and primary deliverable.

### **Stage 4: Consolidate the Machine-Readable Plan**

*   **Goal:** To assemble a final, structured data file that represents the complete, actionable project plan, ready for ingestion by automation systems.
*   **Process:** All project data—including the strategic objectives, phase definitions, and the granular tasks from Stage 3—is consolidated into a single master JSON file. This file is validated against the PRD to ensure perfect alignment.
*   **Output:** A single, finalized JSON file (input_plan.json or similar) containing the full, structured work breakdown for the entire project.
