# Task Lifecycle Protocol

**Objective:** To define the standardized lifecycle for a single unit of work (a "task"), from its creation to its permanent archival, ensuring all work is transparent, verifiable, and contributes to the contributor's skills registry.

The lifecycle consists of four distinct stages:

### Stage 1: Instantiation

*   **Goal:** To formally create and define a task on the system's central work board.
*   **Process:** A task is created, either from a pre-defined project plan or as an ad-hoc work item. It is assigned a unique identifier and its specification is populated with a clear objective, its type (e.g., DEV, DOC), and a description of its primary deliverable.
*   **Output:** A new task visible on the work board, ready to be started.

### Stage 2: Execution & Documentation

*   **Goal:** To complete the work defined in the task specification while maintaining a clear work log.
*   **Process:** The contributor executes the work. Throughout the process, relevant artifacts, research, notes, and progress updates are logged in a dedicated location associated with the task. This creates an auditable trail of the work performed.
*   **Output:** The completed primary deliverable and all associated supporting documentation.

### Stage 3: Verification & Closure

*   **Goal:** To verify that the task's objectives have been met and to formally close it.
*   **Process:** The completed deliverable is reviewed against the task's original specification. Once confirmed that the objectives have been met, the task is marked as "complete" or "done" on the work board.
*   **Output:** A closed task on the work board.

### Stage 4: Archival & Logging

*   **Goal:** To permanently record the completed task and its associated data in the contributor's skills and accomplishments registry.
*   **Process:** The closure of a task on the work board automatically triggers a logging process. Key data from the task—such as its title, category, type, and completion date—is extracted and written as a new entry into the cooperative's central skills registry.
*   **Output:** A new, immutable entry in the skills and accomplishments registry, linking the completed work to the contributor.
