# The Project Asset Lifecycle

To ensure clarity and fairness, all value-generating projects (referred to as "assets") follow a defined, three-phase lifecycle.

#### Phase 1: Development
This is the initial stage where a project is proposed, developed, and launched by a team of members. This phase is focused on bringing an idea to life and creating a viable product or service.

#### Phase 2: Prime Earning Period
Upon successful launch, the asset enters its Prime Earning Period, a predefined term during which the primary financial goal is to reward the original creation team.

*   **Revenue Distribution:** During this period, a significant majority of the net revenue generated by the asset is distributed directly to the members of the creation team, calculated based on their recorded contributions.
*   **Collective Contribution:** A smaller portion of the revenue is directed to the organization's central treasury to cover operational costs and contribute to collective resources.

#### Phase 3: Ongoing Stewardship and Recognition
The end of the Prime Earning Period marks a transition in the asset's stewardship.

*   **Reversion to the Collective:** The intellectual property and operational control of the asset revert to the collective organization. This ensures that successful projects become permanent, shared assets that can provide long-term value to all members. The organization's governing body then determines the asset's future, choosing from three primary paths:
    1.  **Continued Operation:** The asset continues to operate, with its revenue now flowing primarily to the central treasury.
    2.  **Liberation as Open Source:** The asset is released under an open-source license.
    3.  **Incubation as a Federated Collective:** The original creation team is supported in spinning off the asset into a new, independent cooperative.

*   **Long-term Contribution Score (Impact Score):** The profiles of the original creators are updated with a non-monetary, dynamic "Impact Score" tied to their past projects. This score reflects the ongoing value the asset generates for the collective, ensuring their foundational contribution is perpetually and accurately recognized.
