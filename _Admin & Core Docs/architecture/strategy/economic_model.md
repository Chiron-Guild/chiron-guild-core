# The Economic Model

The Guild's economic model is designed for sustainability, equitable wealth distribution, and member-driven innovation. It is built on two core pillars: how we generate value and how we distribute it.

1.  **Value Generation Streams:**

The cooperative generates revenue through two primary modes of operation:

    *   **External Engagements:** We undertake projects for external clients and partners, leveraging the pooled expertise of our members to deliver high-value consulting and development services.
    *   **Internal Innovation:** Members are empowered to propose, develop, and launch their own products and services. This model allows the cooperative to pursue self-directed initiatives, transforming grassroots ideas into valuable assets.
    *   **Collective Data Monetization:** In later phases, and with explicit member opt-in, the Guild may develop products or services derived from the aggregated, anonymized "Collective Analytics Dataset." This creates a long-term value stream that benefits all contributing members, as detailed in our `data_stewardship.md` protocol.

2.  **Equitable Revenue Distribution:**

All revenue generated by the Guild flows through a transparent and equitable distribution protocol:

    *   **First, Reinvestment:** A pre-defined portion of all revenue is allocated to the cooperative's central treasury. This funds shared infrastructure, operational costs, and strategic growth initiatives, strengthening the capabilities of the entire Guild.
    *   **Second, Member Rewards:** The remaining revenue is distributed directly to the members who contributed to the project. This distribution is calculated based on each member's verifiable contributions, which are meticulously tracked in an open and auditable record. This ensures that rewards are directly and transparently tied to proven work and value creation.
