1. Governing Principles: The Stewardship Mandate
This organization rejects the principle of maximizing profit above all other considerations. In its place, we establish a Stewardship Mandate as the primary, binding obligation for all governing bodies and members in representative capacities. This mandate ensures the organization is managed in holistic service to its members and its mission.

The Stewardship Mandate is composed of four co-equal duties:

The Duty of Member Prosperity: To create and maintain systems that ensure the financial health, security, and equitable prosperity of the members. This includes securing fair compensation, ensuring transparent revenue distribution, and building collective funds that provide a robust social safety net.

The Duty of Member Growth and Agency: To foster an environment dedicated to the growth, mastery, and agency of every member. This duty obligates the organization to invest in its educational frameworks, maintain a fair system of verifiable accomplishment, and prioritize work that is meaningful and allows members to develop their skills.

The Duty to the Mission: To ensure that all activities of the organization remain in strict alignment with its publicly stated vision and mission. This duty serves as a permanent check against strategic drift that could compromise our core purpose.

The Duty of Collective Resilience: To responsibly manage the collective assets—both financial and intellectual—to ensure the long-term sustainability and independence of the organization. This includes maintaining a healthy treasury, investing in shared infrastructure, and making strategic decisions that benefit the entire cooperative.

2. The Project Asset Lifecycle
To ensure clarity and fairness, all value-generating projects (referred to as "assets") follow a defined, three-phase lifecycle.

Phase 1: The Development Phase
This is the initial stage where a project is proposed, developed, and launched by a team of members. This phase is focused on bringing an idea to life and creating a viable product or service.

Phase 2: The Prime Earning Period
Upon successful launch, the asset enters its Prime Earning Period, a predefined term (e.g., 3-5 years) during which the primary financial goal is to reward the original creation team.

Revenue Distribution: During this period, a significant majority of the net revenue generated by the asset is distributed directly to the members of the creation team, calculated based on their recorded contributions.

Collective Contribution: A smaller portion of the revenue is directed to the organization's central treasury to cover operational costs and contribute to collective resources.

Phase 3: Ongoing Stewardship and Recognition
The end of the Prime Earning Period marks a transition in the asset's stewardship.

Reversion to the Collective: The intellectual property and operational control of the asset revert to the collective organization. This ensures that successful projects become permanent, shared assets that can provide long-term value to all members. The organization's governing body then determines the asset's future, choosing from three primary paths:

Continued Operation: The asset continues to operate, with its revenue now flowing primarily to the central treasury to fund collective benefits and strategic investments.

Liberation as Open Source: The governing body may vote to release the asset's intellectual property under an open-source license, justifying the decision by its alignment with the organization's mission.

Incubation as a Federated Collective: The governing body may support the original creation team in spinning off the asset into a new, independent cooperative that remains strategically allied with the Guild.

Long-term Contribution Score (Impact Score): The profiles of the original creators are updated with a non-monetary, dynamic "Impact Score" tied to their past projects. This score functions similarly to a citation count or PageRank, algorithmically reflecting the ongoing value the asset generates for the collective. As an asset is used more frequently, integrated into other projects, or generates more revenue for the treasury, the Impact Score of its original creators increases, ensuring their foundational contribution is perpetually and accurately recognized within the organization's reputation system.
