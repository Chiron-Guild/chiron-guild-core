# Guild Charter

**Version: 1.1**
**Status: Draft**

## 0. Preamble

This document serves as the master summary of the Chiron Guild's identity, strategy, and core operational principles. It is a Neutral Canon document, providing a concise, single source of truth derived from the Guild's foundational protocols.

### Core Thesis: Augmentation & Adaptation

The AI-augmented future we are building, where the "last 20%" of complex work is constantly being redefined, is a future of perpetual challenge and growth.

The Guild is the vessel designed to help its members navigate that future. We achieve this not just by providing access to advanced tools, but by building a system that explicitly values and rewards the meta-skill of adaptation itself. Our protocols are architected to create tight feedback loops for learning, and our economic model is designed to recognize the act of acquiring new capabilities as a first-class contribution to the collective.

This thesis—that a human armed with the right system for learning can always stay ahead of automation—is the strategic foundation of the Chiron Guild.

## 1. Vision

To create a new economic infrastructure for knowledge work, fundamentally shifting the paradigm from extractive employment to collective ownership. This infrastructure is worker-owned and augmented by artificial intelligence, designed to provide its members with genuine economic leverage, agency, and a more equitable and fulfilling future of work.

---

## 2. Mission

To build and operate a worker-owned, AI-augmented digital cooperative. This is achieved through a self-reinforcing loop of three primary activities:
1.  **Build:** Systematically developing and improving the Guild's own infrastructure and protocols.
2.  **Use:** Performing collective work for internal projects and external clients to generate value.
3.  **Grow:** Distributing open-source frameworks to expand the network and its methodologies.

## 3. Core Values & Guiding Mandate

All Guild operations and decisions are guided by a set of core values, which are actively enforced through a binding mandate for all leadership actions.

#### Foundational Principles
*   Equity & Collective Ownership
*   Sovereignty & Agency
*   Growth & Mastery
*   Augmentation, Not Replacement
*   Precision & Clarity
*   Stewardship of Collective Assets

#### The Stewardship Mandate
To ensure these principles are upheld, all significant leadership decisions are bound by the **Stewardship Mandate**. This consists of four co-equal duties that must be holistically balanced:

1.  **Member Prosperity**
2.  **Member Growth & Agency**
3.  **Mission Fidelity**
4.  **Collective Resilience**

This framework serves as the primary, binding obligation for Guild governance. The full mandate is defined in `architecture/identity/stewardship_mandate.md`.

#### The Stewardship Mandate
These principles are upheld through the **Stewardship Mandate**, a set of four co-equal duties that serve as the primary, binding obligation for all Guild decision-making. The full mandate is defined in `architecture/identity/stewardship_mandate.md`.

## 4. Current Strategic Phase

The Guild is currently operating in **Phase 0: Foundation**.

*   **Focus:** Core System & Process Development.
*   **Core Activity:** Building, testing, and refining the initial systems required for cooperative operations.
*   **Success Metric:** The system is fully operational and valuable for a single user.

---

## 5. Economic Model

The Guild's economic model enables value generation through both external client engagements and internal innovation. All revenue flows through a transparent distribution protocol that first reinvests in the collective treasury and then rewards contributing members.

The precise mechanics for how value-generating assets are developed, managed, and monetized are detailed in the **Project Asset Lifecycle**, defined in `architecture/strategy/project_lifecycle.md`.

---

## 6. Core Canonical Protocols

The Guild's work is structured by a set of standardized, canonical protocols. The primary protocols include:

*   **`stewardship_mandate.md`**: Defines the binding duties for Guild governance.
*   **`project_lifecycle.md`**: Outlines the economic lifecycle for all value-generating assets.
*   **`work_breakdown_protocol.md`**: Provides a standardized process for decomposing a complex project into actionable tasks.
*   **`task_lifecycle_protocol.md`**: Defines the standardized lifecycle for a single unit of work, from creation to archival.
*   **`task_taxonomy_protocol.md`**: Defines the standardized categories and types for all units of work.
