# Guild Charter

**Version: 1.0**
**Status: Draft**

## 0. Preamble

This document serves as the master summary of the Chiron Guild's identity, strategy, and core operational principles. It is a Neutral Canon document, providing a concise, single source of truth derived from the Guild's foundational protocols.

## 1. Vision

To create a new economic infrastructure for knowledge work, fundamentally shifting the paradigm from extractive employment to collective ownership. This infrastructure is worker-owned and augmented by artificial intelligence, designed to provide its members with genuine economic leverage, agency, and a more equitable and fulfilling future of work.

---

## 2. Mission

To build and operate a worker-owned, AI-augmented digital cooperative. This is achieved through a self-reinforcing loop of three primary activities:
1.  **Build:** Systematically developing and improving the Guild's own infrastructure and protocols.
2.  **Use:** Performing collective work for internal projects and external clients to generate value.
3.  **Grow:** Distributing open-source frameworks to expand the network and its methodologies.

---

## 3. Core Values

All Guild operations and decisions are guided by the following principles:

*   **Equity & Collective Ownership:** Value is owned and controlled by those who create it, with rewards directly linked to verifiable contributions.
*   **Sovereignty & Agency:** Systems are designed to enhance personal agency, data sovereignty, and self-determination.
*   **Growth & Mastery:** We are committed to perpetual learning and creating structured pathways for skill development.
*   **Augmentation, Not Replacement:** Technology is used to augment and amplify human creativity and strategic thinking.
*   **Precision & Clarity:** Ambiguity is actively eliminated through clear definitions, transparent protocols, and meticulous tracking of all work.
*   **Stewardship of Collective Assets:** The core infrastructure is owned by the cooperative in perpetuity and cannot be leveraged against member interests.

---

## 4. Current Strategic Phase

The Guild is currently operating in **Phase 0: Foundation**.

*   **Focus:** Core System & Process Development.
*   **Core Activity:** Building, testing, and refining the initial systems required for cooperative operations, including task management, automation, and the contribution ledger.
*   **Success Metric:** The system is fully operational and valuable for a single user, enabling them to manage all personal and professional projects within the framework.

---

## 5. Economic Model

The Guild's economic model is built on two pillars:

1.  **Value Generation:** Revenue is generated through two streams:
    *   **External Engagements:** Undertaking projects for clients and partners.
    *   **Internal Innovation:** Developing and launching self-directed products and services.

2.  **Revenue Distribution:** All revenue is distributed via a transparent protocol:
    *   **First, Reinvestment:** A portion of revenue is allocated to the cooperative's central treasury to fund operations and growth.
    *   **Second, Member Rewards:** The remaining revenue is distributed to contributing members based on an auditable record of their verifiable contributions.

## 6. Core Operational Protocols

The Guild's work is structured by a set of standardized, canonical protocols. The primary protocols include:

*   **Task Taxonomy Protocol:** Defines the standardized categories (`CORE`, `PERS`, `PROD`, `CLIENT`) and types (`DEV`, `DOC`, `STR`, etc.) for all units of work.
*   **Work Breakdown Protocol:** A standardized process for decomposing a complex project into a formal requirements document and a structured plan of actionable tasks.
*   **Task Lifecycle Protocol:** Defines the four stages for any unit of work: Instantiation, Execution, Verification, and Archival.
