# Guild Op: CCG-DOC-001 Formalize V2.2 Core Game Mechanics & Calculation Rules

## Category: DOC
## Parent Project: Core Game Mechanics Automation
## Assignees: @Kin-Caid

## Objective:
To formalize and document the V2.2 Core Game Mechanics and Calculation Rules, translating them from Miro boards into structured, pseudo-code/algorithmic descriptions suitable for technical implementation.

## Deliverables:
- A comprehensive technical specification document translating Miro rules into pseudo-code/algorithmic descriptions.
- Pseudo-code or algorithmic representations for all identified core game mechanics (e.g., damage calculation, resource generation, status effects).
- Clear definitions of all relevant game state variables and their interactions within the documented mechanics.

## Associated Skills:
- Technical writing
- Pseudo-code development
- Algorithmic design
- Game systems analysis
- Miro board interpretation

## Awarded Guild Seal:
GS-DOC-Core-Game-Mechanics-Formalization-v1

## Context & Background:
This operation is crucial for transitioning core game mechanics from conceptual Miro designs into a concrete, executable specification, enabling future automation and development within the Core Game Mechanics Automation sector.

## Estimated Effort:
Medium

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- Technical specification document is complete, coherent, and covers all identified V2.2 core game mechanics.
- All calculation rules are translated into clear, unambiguous pseudo-code or algorithmic descriptions.
- Document is reviewed and approved by relevant Guild stakeholders for accuracy and completeness.
