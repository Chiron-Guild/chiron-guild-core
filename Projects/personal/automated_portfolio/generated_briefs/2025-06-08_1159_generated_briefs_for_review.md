- Git version control
- Static site generation

## Awarded Guild Seal:
GS-DEV-Jekyll-Forge-Scaffolding-Configuration-v1

## Context & Background:
This operation is crucial for establishing the foundational architecture for the Automated Portfolio Website, enabling subsequent content and feature development.

## Estimated Effort:
Medium

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- Jekyll build process completes without errors.
- The generated _site directory contains the expected static files.
- _config.yml contains specified base settings (e.g., site title, permalinks).

---

## Notes for Operatives:
- Ensure all work is committed to a dedicated feature branch (e.g., `feature/guild-op-[ISSUE_NUMBER]`). Document progress in `Context Compilations` within `archives/PORT-DEV-001/`. Close this issue upon completion to trigger associated Guild automations.
```

**Scribe's Generation Notes (from LLM):** Deliverables expanded from primary. `parent_project` value taken literally as per instruction.

# Guild Op: PORT-DEV-002 Scribe Data Ingress Script

## Category: DEV
## Parent Project: Automated Portfolio Website
## Assignees: @Kin-Caid

## Objective:
To create a robust shell script for automating the local data ingress process, ensuring `operative_registry.json` is correctly integrated into the Jekyll project for development.

## Deliverables:
- A shell script (`scripts/sync_registry.sh`) that reliably copies `operative_registry.json` from its source into the Jekyll project's `_data` directory.

- Confirmation of successful data ingress for local development environments.

## Associated Skills:
- Shell scripting
- File system operations
- Jekyll project structure
- Data synchronization
- Automation scripting

## Awarded Guild Seal:
GS-DEV-Data-Ingress-Script-Local-Development-v1

## Context & Background:
This operation is crucial for establishing a consistent and automated local development environment, specifically for handling the `operative_registry.json` data required by the Jekyll project. It falls under the Forge Scaffolding & Data Ingress sector.

## Estimated Effort:
Medium

## Verification/Acceptance Criteria:
- The `scripts/sync_registry.sh` script executes without errors.
- The `operative_registry.json` file is successfully copied to the Jekyll project's `_data` directory.
- Jekyll site generation reflects the synced `operative_registry.json` data locally and accurately.

---

## Notes for Operatives:
- Ensure all work is committed to a dedicated feature branch (e.g., `feature/guild-op-[ISSUE_NUMBER]`). Document progress in `Context Compilations` within `archives/PORT-DEV-002/`. Close this issue upon completion to trigger associated Guild automations.
```

**Scribe's Generation Notes (from LLM):** Generated based on provided input. Assumed 'Medium' effort for robustness and inferred 'scripting', 'data-management' labels from the task description.
