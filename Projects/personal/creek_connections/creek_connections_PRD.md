## 1. Executive Summary

This project will develop "Creek Connections," an interactive, web-based game for the public and key stakeholders. The game is designed to automate complex watershed simulations, enhance education on the trade-offs of stormwater management, and provide data-driven insights to support the Rain to River Strategic Plan.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current tabletop version of the "Creek Connections" game, while a valuable educational tool, is limited by manual facilitation. This process is time-consuming, prone to calculation errors, and cannot be scaled to effectively engage a broad public audience. Consequently, stakeholders and community members lack an accessible, dynamic way to explore and understand the critical trade-offs involved in stormwater infrastructure management, operations, and maintenance, hindering informed participation in strategic planning.

## 3. Strategic Objectives & Business Goals

*   To empower effective community engagement and data-driven strategic planning for watershed resilience through the delivery of an interactive, automated digital game.
*   To solidify the Chiron Guild's leadership in civic technology by delivering an automated digital game that effectively educates stakeholders and generates actionable insights for sustainable infrastructure.
*   To pioneer a replicable model for interactive policy engagement by creating a scalable, automated digital game that translates complex systems into accessible learning experiences for diverse stakeholders.
*   To showcase the Chiron Guild's 'Precision Shell' by engineering a robust, automated digital game that revolutionizes stakeholder education on infrastructure management, thereby supplanting less effective traditional engagement methods.

## 4. Scope & High-Level Components (Epics)

### 4.1. Component/Phase 1: Core Game Mechanics Automation
*   Implement the fundamental game logic, rules engine, and automated calculations (such as water flow, O&M, and scoring) as defined in the V2.2 feature set.

### 4.2. Component/Phase 2: Interactive User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
*   Develop the dynamic visual interface, interactive map, and user controls that allow players to engage intuitively with the game and receive real-time feedback.

### 4.3. Component/Phase 3: Campaign Progression & Content Integration
*   Implement the multi-phase campaign structure, manage game state across phases, and integrate all specific game content such as event cards and phase-specific objectives.

### 4.4. Component/Phase 4: Gameplay Data Logging & Analytics Framework
*   Establish robust systems for automatically collecting, storing, and enabling the export of player actions and game outcome data to support analysis and insights.

### 4.5. Component/Phase 5: Finalization, Accessibility, & Deployment
*   Refine the game through comprehensive testing, ensure adherence to accessibility standards for broader public use, and prepare the application for stable web-based deployment.

## 5. User Stories / Key Features

- [ ] As a **player**, I can **place and upgrade infrastructure on an interactive map** so that I can **strategically manage stormwater and reduce flood impacts**.
- [ ] As a **player**, I can **view my budget, scores, and round progress in real-time** so that I can **make informed decisions throughout the game**.
- [ ] As a **player**, I can **experience the game through a multi-phase campaign** so that I can **understand escalating challenges related to infrastructure build-out, maintenance, and optimization.**
- [ ] As a **facilitator/planner**, I can **export gameplay data** so that I can **analyze player decisions and game outcomes to gather insights for the Rain to River Strategic Plan.**
- [ ] As a **stakeholder**, I can **access and play the game on a standard web browser** so that I can **learn about stormwater management and infrastructure trade-offs in an engaging way.**

## 6. Out of Scope

-   **Backend Data Persistence:** This version will not include a server-side database for user accounts, global leaderboards, or persistent game state beyond client-side storage (e.g., LocalStorage).
-   **Multiplayer Functionality:** The game is designed for cooperative play through a single interface; network-based multiplayer (e.g., multiple concurrent players across different devices) is not included in this scope.
-   **In-Game Analytics Dashboard:** While data will be logged and exportable, this project does not include the development of an integrated, real-time analytics dashboard within the game itself.
-   **Full Mobile App Development:** Focus is on a responsive web-based application, not a native mobile application.

## 7. Success Metrics & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-   **Engagement Rate:** Achieve an average game session duration of at least 15 minutes, coupled with a positive user feedback rating of 80% or higher from post-game surveys.
-   **Learning Impact:** X% of survey respondents correctly articulate key takeaways related to O&M trade-offs and infrastructure lifecycle after completing a full game campaign.
-   **Data Quality:** Successfully collect and export complete gameplay data for 95% of all initiated game sessions to support external analysis.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

-   **Assumptions:**
    -   The V2.2 tabletop game rules and core content (e.g., Event Cards, infrastructure parameters) provided in Miro are finalized and will remain stable throughout the development lifecycle.
    -   Target users (public, stakeholders) have basic web literacy and access to modern, compatible web browsers for game access.
-   **Dependencies:**
    -   Timely provision of all required game content (e.g., final Event Card text, specific numerical balancing data) from the game design team.
    -   Availability of subject matter experts (SMEs) from the Rain to River Strategic Plan team for clarification on rules, content, and strategic insights.
    -   Selection and provision of a suitable web hosting environment for deployment.
