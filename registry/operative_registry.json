      "Expected deliverables for the operative.",
      "A list of \"Skills to be Demonstrated\".",
      "The \"Awarded Guild Seal\" field (e.g., `[PLACEHOLDER - AUTO-GENERATED UPON PR MERGE]` or a specific predefined Seal ID if applicable to that child Op).",
      "A link to its corresponding (even if nascent) detailed Guild Op Brief (e.g., in Google Drive or Guild Archives, if applicable).",
      "Appropriate GitHub labels (e.g., `guild-op`, `phase-0`, `op-type:<TYPE>`, `status:open`, `priority:medium`).",
      "A Context Compilation document stored in `archives/CHIRON-STR-002/context_CHIRON-STR-002.md`, detailing the operational log for the creation of these initial Guild Ops, including the rationale for their selection and prioritization."
